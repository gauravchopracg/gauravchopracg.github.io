Hi, my name is Gaurav. I’m a deep learning enthusiast, who loves to tinker with smartphones and engines when I have time.

When I’m not coding for my research, I am working on projects using open source data, writing tutorials to share what I learn or repairing stuffs.

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you find something useful or interesting. If you do, be sure to leave a comment.
