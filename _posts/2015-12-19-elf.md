title: "A peek at ELF" 
---

## Motivation

Having learnt an object file has `.text` section for code, `.data` section for data, `.bss` section for uninitialized data, and so on and so forth, it's still unclear how it's mapped into a real ELF file. How an elf file can represent these informations? Through `objdump`, we may peek into the content of these sections.

```
objdump -s obj/boot/boot.out 
```

The result looks like 

```
obj/boot/boot.out:     file format elf32-i386

Contents of section .text:
 7c00 fafc31c0 8ed88ec0 8ed0e464 a80275fa  ..1........d..u.
 7c10 b0d1e664 e464a802 75fab0df e6600f01  ...d.d..u....`..
...

Contents of section .eh_frame:
 7d80 14000000 00000000 017a5200 017c0801  .........zR..|..
 7d90 1b0c0404 88010000 1c000000 1c000000  ................
 
...
```

It's misleading for a beginner to look at this directly, because from output it seems that the main contents are interleaved with those headers; however, __they are not__. Now I'm doing a little mapping how the binary can be interpreted into that way. In fact, the headers locates at the beginning and the end of file; all the data and code in different sections or segments are bunched together in the middle.


## Tools

* `readelf` (`greadelf` for mac, installed by `brew install binutils`)
* `objdump` (`gobjdump` for mac)
* [wxHexEditor](http://www.wxhexeditor.org/)

## File layout

<table markdown="1" border="1" style="margin:auto;">
<tr><td>ELF header</td></tr>
<tr><td>program header</td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td>program header</td></tr>
<tr><td height="100" align="center">code & data</td></tr>
<tr><td>section header</td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td></tr>
<tr><td>section header</td></tr>
</table>

## Example

Take the object file [boot.out]({{ BASE_PATH }}/images/20151219/boot.out) for example. You may use [wxHexEditor](http://www.wxhexeditor.org/) to peek its raw hex like this.

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/20151219/wxHexEditor.png" style="width:80%;"/>

`readelf` does a little interpretation on these hex's.

```
readelf --all boot.out
```

The result looks like

```
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
...
Section Headers:
  [Nr] Name              Type            Addr     Off    Size   ES Flg Lk Inf Al
  [ 0]                   NULL            00000000 000000 000000 00      0   0  0
...
```

### ELF header

The first part of the file is `ELF header`. The most notable characteristic is the magic number `7f 45 4c 46`, where `45 4c 46` interprets as `ELF` in ASCII.

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/20151219/elf-header.png" style="width:80%;"/>

Actually this is the `e_ident` field defined by [struct ElfN_Ehdr](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/elf.5.html). For more detail, please refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format).

### Program header and section header

The data and code part of a program can be divided into pieces. In a `linker`'s view, it's divided into `sections`, and the the meta-data of these sections are stored in `section header` table (from the figure above we can see it's located at the end of the file). In `kernel`'s (executor) view, data and code can be divide into `segments`, and the meta-data of them are stored in `program header` table.

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/20151219/sec-seg.png" style="width:60%;"/>

### Section header string table

Well, its name is a bit long. Actually it is a `section` of the file, and it is one of the sources how `objdump` know the names of each section. First let's find it in the raw hex file.

```
readelf --all boot.out
```

and look at this

```
ELF Header:
  ...
  Start of section headers:          4760 (bytes into file)
  ...
  Size of section headers:           40 (bytes)
  ...
  Section header string table index: 6
  ...
```

It says the start of section headers is 4760, and using this info, `readelf` can further interpret the section headers for us (continue on the former result)

```
Section Headers:
  [Nr] Name              Type            Addr     Off    Size   ES Flg Lk Inf Al
  [ 0]                   NULL            00000000 000000 000000 00      0   0  0
  ...
  [ 6] .shstrtab         STRTAB          00000000 001254 000043 00      0   0  1
  ...
```

Actually we may find the `.shstrtab` entry ourselves. As from the ELF header we know that the start of section header is 4760, and that size of them is 40, and that the index of `.shstrtab` is 6, we can calculate the start of `.shstrtab` is $4760 + 6 \times 40 = 5000$.

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/20151219/entry-shstrtab.png" style="width:80%;"/>

It's around there. $[5000, 5040)$ of `boot.out` maps to `struct Elf32_Shdr` ([ref](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/elf.5.html)).

```
typedef struct {
               uint32_t   sh_name;
               uint32_t   sh_type;
               uint64_t   sh_flags;
               Elf64_Addr sh_addr;
               Elf64_Off  sh_offset;
               uint64_t   sh_size;
               uint32_t   sh_link;
               uint32_t   sh_info;
               uint64_t   sh_addralign;
               uint64_t   sh_entsize;
           } Elf64_Shdr;
```

The bytes at 5000 is 0x11, and it should be interpreted into its name, i.e. `.shstrtab`. How can? Official explanation is

> sh_name   This member specifies the name of the section.  Its value is an index into the section header string table section, giving the location of a null-terminated string.

So there's a section `.shstrtab` that records all the names of sections. Where is it? Clue is given by this table entry. Let's look at the interpreted version by `elfread`.

```
Section Headers:
  [Nr] Name              Type            Addr     Off    Size   ES Flg Lk Inf Al
  ...
  [ 6] .shstrtab         STRTAB          00000000 001254 000043 00      0   0  1
  ...
```

Offset is 0x1254, size is 0x43, so we will look into [0x1254, 0x1297).

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/20151219/shstrtab.png" style="width:80%;"/>

From the right, we can see that we are finding the right place. Then what does `0x11` mean? This index is a bit confusing. It's just the index in that char sequence. $0x1254 + 0x11 = 0x1265$, so let's look at the string starts at 0x1265.

<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/20151219/name-shstrtab.png" style="width:80%;"/>

That's correct, `.shstrtab`, and that is what we are looking for. 


## Conclusion

This post looks into some aspects of ELF file format. An example is given to illustrate how `objdump -s` may know the locations and names of the sections from it.
